# AWS Cognito Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed: "Auth UserPool not configured" Error

The error was caused by Amplify configuration not being properly initialized on the client side. Here's what was fixed:

### Changes Made:

1. **Created AmplifyProvider** (`src/components/AmplifyProvider.tsx`)
   - Moved Amplify configuration to client-side component
   - Added environment variable validation
   - Added debug logging

2. **Updated Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Wrapped app with AmplifyProvider before AuthProvider
   - Added ErrorBoundary for better error handling
   - Added ConfigCheck component for environment validation

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added defensive checks in auth functions
   - Created ErrorBoundary component
   - Added configuration status checker

## üîç How to Verify It's Working:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools and look for:
```
AWS Config Debug: {
  userPoolId: "ap-south-1_...",
  userPoolClientId: "78usab440h...",
  region: "ap-south-1"
}
Amplify configured successfully
```

### 2. Visit Debug Page
Go to `http://localhost:3000/debug` to see:
- Environment variables status
- Test configuration button
- Detailed error messages if any

### 3. Test Signup Flow
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Fill out the form
3. Should see "Creating Account..." instead of error
4. Check email for verification code

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: Still seeing "Auth UserPool not configured"
**Solutions:**
1. **Restart dev server** - Environment variables need server restart
2. **Check .env.local file** - Must be in project root
3. **Verify variable names** - Must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

### Issue: Environment variables showing as undefined
**Solutions:**
1. **File location** - `.env.local` must be in project root (same level as package.json)
2. **No quotes needed** - Don't wrap values in quotes
3. **Restart required** - Always restart dev server after changing .env.local

### Issue: Network errors during signup
**Solutions:**
1. **Check AWS region** - Must match your Cognito User Pool region
2. **Verify User Pool ID** - Should look like `ap-south-1_xxxxxxxxx`
3. **Check Client ID** - Should be a long alphanumeric string

### Issue: "User does not exist" after signup
**Solutions:**
1. **Complete email verification** - Check spam folder
2. **Wait for verification** - Don't try to login before verifying email
3. **Check User Pool settings** - Ensure email verification is enabled

## üîß Quick Fixes:

### Reset Everything:
```bash
# Stop dev server
# Delete .env.local
# Recreate .env.local with correct values
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Check Configuration:
```bash
# Visit debug page
http://localhost:3000/debug
```

### Test Basic Flow:
1. `/signup` - Create account
2. Check email - Get verification code
3. Enter code - Complete verification
4. `/login` - Sign in with credentials

## üìã Environment Variables Template:

```env
# AWS Cognito Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=ap-south-1_6AVT32LeX
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=78usab440hhp2f16mvnnqmh8ce
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

- No red error banner at top of page
- Console shows "Amplify configured successfully"
- Signup form shows loading state instead of error
- Debug page shows all environment variables
- Can create account and receive verification email

Your authentication should now be working properly!
